Help me design a modern and professional homepage UI for my LiveKit + Deepgram powered interview assistant.

🎯 Objective: Create a pre-interview setup screen for the **interviewer** to configure the session before starting the meeting.

---

📐 Design goals:
- Modern layout (glassmorphism/card design, shadows, subtle gradients)
- Centered content or responsive split layout (left info, right form)
- Good use of font hierarchy, spacing, and icons
- Mobile responsive
- Minimal but polished, with focus on UX

---

🧱 Sections to include:

### 🔹 Header
- Logo + title: “Interviewer Assistant”
- Subtext: “Smart, time-managed interviews with real-time transcription and AI-powered suggestions”

### 🔹 Form Section (Card-style)

Design this as a sleek input card or floating panel with the following inputs:

1. **Room Setup**
   - Field: “Room Name” (text input)
   - Button: “🎥 Start Interview” (bold primary)

2. **Job Description**
   - Label: “📝 Job Description for the Role”
   - Textarea (placeholder: “e.g., This is an operations role at Uber focused on scaling supply in Tier 2 cities…”)

3. **Interview Plan (Timeline)**
   - Label: “📅 Interview Structure”
   - Textarea input (multi-line)
   - Placeholder: 
     ```
     Intro - 5
     Past Projects - 15
     Case Study - 15
     Coding - 20
     Wrap-up - 5
     ```

4. **Transcription Provider Toggle**
   - Label: “🎙 Transcription Engine”
   - Toggle with options: Deepgram (default), ElevenLabs (coming soon)

🎨 Design Suggestions:
- Use TailwindCSS or modern CSS classes (e.g., `shadow-xl`, `backdrop-blur`, `rounded-2xl`, `bg-white/80`, etc.)
- Fonts: Inter, DM Sans, or similar modern fonts
- Use icons for each section (from Lucide or Heroicons)
- Responsive: stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

---

🧠 Other Details:
- Store form values in global state or pass via URL query params when user clicks “Start Interview”
- Use a dark or soft gradient background to give contrast to white cards

---

✅ Please generate the full React component (with TailwindCSS or modern styles) that implements this homepage. Also create a sample screenshot in code if possible.
