# LiveKit Transcription Application

## Overview

This is a fully functional real-time video conferencing application built with React, Express, and LiveKit that includes live speech-to-text transcription capabilities. Users can create video meetings, see participants in a responsive grid, control their audio/video, and view live transcriptions of their speech using Deepgram's API. The application successfully captures PCM audio data and streams it to Deepgram for real-time speech-to-text conversion.
